# Forensics_Reader
A reader thats is supposed to be able to track a users behaviour. 
This is very much a work in progress, since I'm learning python as I go. 
The idea is that it will parse a lot of artifacts in the registry, junplists, prefetch, linkfiles, and more. 

It uses a mixture og my own research and quite a few other people's libraries. Below is a list of the ones that aren't python native:

pyqt: (https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download)

Python-registry: (https://github.com/williballenthin/python-registry)

ShellBags: (https://github.com/williballenthin/shellbags)

More will follow and feel free to reach out if you have questions of ideas for improvements
